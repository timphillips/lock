### How to Build and Run

This is a personal project to learn about RxJS. The only dependency is RxJS v6.3.3.

To keep things simple, the project does not use a package manager or a module bundler. Generic lock-related utilities are exported from `lock.js` using an old-school IIFE. The demo site is initialized in `demo.js`.

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to run the demo.
